								XEAT  is a  food ordering smart and easy online mobile application

The customer app helps the customer to access the online food ordering platforms, search for the right restaurant or the dish they want to order, place their orders and pay easily
The best way to make it works is to have a smart list of all the restaurants and cuisines organized by location, type of food (fast food, or more gourmet dishes), food preferences (vegetarian, meat lovers, any special diets like gluten-free diets), different nation’s cuisine, etc.

								<b>Cancellation & Refund Policy </b>
                                <p>
								SORRY… we generally DO NOT entertain any Order Cancellations – because once the order is placed on the Restaurant  – the Restaurants generally DO NOT entertain cancellation of orders. However, in case you request us for an Order Cancellation prior to the order being placed on the Restaurant – then the cancellation of the order is up to the discretion of XEAT. In case of Delivery of Order being LATE or BAD or INCORRECT… XEAT  adheres to a very high standard of Quality of Services – and is very STRICT in terms of achieving a very high level of Customer Satisfaction. Hence, in case of an Order being LATE or BAD or INCORRECT – wing to a process related issue of XEAT – we generally DO NOT charge the customer for the order… but, this is totally up to the discretion of XEAT.
In case of Refund it will remain in the customer's wallet as a coupon. The customer can use the coupon on repeat orders. Customer who wants to get refund as Cash should contact our customer Service Agent.
